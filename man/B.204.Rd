Target Soil Properties:

   SOC - Soil Organic Carbon
   \itemize{
   \item Code: \code{SOC_target}
   \item Unit: \%
   \item Protocol: Measured through titration after oxidization of the organic carbon (Walkley & Black 1934)
   \item Sampling Date: October 2016
   \item Sampling Depth: 0 – 20 cm
   }

   pH
   \itemize{
   \item Code: \code{pH_target}
   \item Unit: Unitless
   \item Protocol: Measured in water suspension with a glass electrode with a 2.5:1 liquid:soil volumetric ratio
   \item Sampling Date: October 2016
   \item Sampling Depth: 0 – 20 cm
}

   Clay
   \itemize{
   \item Code: \code{Clay_target}
   \item Unit: \%
   \item Protocol: Sieve-Pipette method, measured through fractioning the soil into the sand fractions by sieving, and the silt and clay fractions by sedimentation in water (Gee and Bauder 1986)
   \item Sampling Date: October 2016
   \item Sampling Depth: 0 – 20 cm
   }

  \item Sensing: Digital elevation model raster (30 m) based on synthetic aperture radar from “Copernicus Open Access Hub”
  \item Processing: Calculating \code{Slope} with \code{\link[raster]{terrain}} function of the \pkg{raster} package, extracting DEM values from raster at soil sampling locations
  \item Sensing Date: January 2010
  }

  \item Number Features: 2
  \item Code(s): \code{NDVI, GNDVI}
  \item Unit: Unitless
  \item Sensing: Sentinel-2 Image during vegetative period (Level-2A) from “Copernicus Open Access Hub”
  \item Processing: Calculating \code{NDVI} as (B08 - B04) / (B08 + B04) and \code{GNDVI} as (B08 - B03) / (B08 + B03), extracting VI values from raster at soil sampling locations
